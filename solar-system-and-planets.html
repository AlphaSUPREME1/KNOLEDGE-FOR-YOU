<h2>Our Solar System and Its Planets – A Complete Guide for Students</h2>

<p>
The solar system is a vast and fascinating region of space that consists of the Sun,
eight planets, their moons, asteroids, comets, and other celestial bodies.
It is located in the Milky Way galaxy and formed about 4.6 billion years ago.
Understanding the solar system helps us learn how Earth supports life and how planets evolve over time.
</p>

<h3>🌞 The Sun – The Heart of the Solar System</h3>
<p>
The Sun is a massive ball of hot gases mainly composed of hydrogen and helium.
It contains more than 99% of the total mass of the solar system.
The energy released by nuclear fusion in the Sun provides heat and light,
making life on Earth possible.
Without the Sun, the solar system would not exist.
</p>

<h3>🪐 Classification of Planets</h3>
<p>
The eight planets of the solar system are divided into two groups:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inner Planets:</strong> Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars</li>
<li><strong>Outer Planets:</strong> Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune</li>
</ul>

<h3>🌍 Inner Planets (Terrestrial Planets)</h3>

<h4>1. Mercury</h4>
<p>
Mercury is the smallest and closest planet to the Sun.
It has no atmosphere to retain heat, leading to extreme temperature variations.
Mercury completes one revolution around the Sun in just 88 Earth days.
</p>

<h4>2. Venus</h4>
<p>
Venus is often called Earth’s twin due to its similar size and structure.
However, its thick carbon dioxide atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect,
making it the hottest planet in the solar system.
</p>

<h4>3. Earth</h4>
<p>
Earth is the only known planet that supports life.
It has liquid water, oxygen-rich air, and a suitable climate.
Earth’s magnetic field protects it from harmful solar radiation.
</p>

<h4>4. Mars</h4>
<p>
Mars is known as the Red Planet because of iron oxide on its surface.
Scientists believe that Mars once had water and may have supported microbial life.
It is a major focus of space exploration.
</p>

<h3>🌌 Outer Planets (Gas and Ice Giants)</h3>

<h4>5. Jupiter</h4>
<p>
Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system.
It is a gas giant with powerful storms, including the Great Red Spot.
Jupiter’s strong gravity helps protect inner planets from asteroids.
</p>

<h4>6. Saturn</h4>
<p>
Saturn is famous for its beautiful ring system.
It is made mostly of hydrogen and helium and has dozens of moons.
</p>

<h4>7. Uranus</h4>
<p>
Uranus rotates on its side, making it unique among all planets.
It appears blue-green due to methane gas in its atmosphere.
</p>

<h4>8. Neptune</h4>
<p>
Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun.
It is known for extremely strong winds and dark storms.
</p>

<h3>☄️ Other Members of the Solar System</h3>
<p>
Apart from planets, the solar system contains dwarf planets like Pluto,
asteroids found mainly in the asteroid belt,
and comets that originate from the outer regions of the solar system.
</p>

<h3>📚 Importance of Studying the Solar System</h3>
<p>
Studying the solar system helps scientists understand the origin of Earth,
predict space events, and search for life beyond our planet.
It also inspires scientific curiosity and technological advancement.
</p>

<h3>📌 Conclusion</h3>
<p>
The solar system is an incredible example of the complexity of the universe.
Each planet has unique features and characteristics.
Learning about the solar system helps students develop a deeper appreciation
for space science and our place in the cosmos.
