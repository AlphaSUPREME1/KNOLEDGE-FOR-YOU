        <h2>Our Solar System and Its Planets</h2>

        <p>
            The solar system is a vast and fascinating part of the universe. It consists of the Sun,
            eight planets, their moons, asteroids, comets, and other celestial bodies.
            Our solar system is located in the Milky Way galaxy and plays a crucial role in supporting life on Earth.
        </p>

        <h3>🌞 The Sun</h3>
        <p>
            The Sun is the center of the solar system and is a massive ball of hot gases.
            It provides heat and light, making life on Earth possible.
            The Sun’s gravity holds all the planets in their orbits.
        </p>

        <h3>🪐 The Eight Planets</h3>

        <h4>1. Mercury</h4>
        <p>
            Mercury is the smallest planet and the closest to the Sun.
            It has no atmosphere to trap heat, which causes extreme temperature changes.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Venus</h4>
        <p>
            Venus is the hottest planet due to its thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide.
            It is often called Earth’s twin because of its similar size.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Earth</h4>
        <p>
            Earth is the only planet known to support life.
            It has water, oxygen, and a suitable climate, making it unique in the solar system.
        </p>

        <h4>4. Mars</h4>
        <p>
            Mars is called the Red Planet due to iron oxide on its surface.
            Scientists believe Mars once had water and may have supported life.
        </p>

        <h4>5. Jupiter</h4>
        <p>
            Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system.
            It is a gas giant with a famous storm called the Great Red Spot.
        </p>

        <h4>6. Saturn</h4>
        <p>
            Saturn is known for its beautiful ring system.
            It is a gas giant made mostly of hydrogen and helium.
        </p>

        <h4>7. Uranus</h4>
        <p>
            Uranus rotates on its side, making it unique among planets.
            It has a pale blue color due to methane gas in its atmosphere.
        </p>

        <h4>8. Neptune</h4>
        <p>
            Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun.
            It has very strong winds and a deep blue color.
        </p>

        <h3>☄️ Other Objects in the Solar System</h3>
        <p>
            Apart from planets, the solar system contains asteroids, comets, and dwarf planets like Pluto.
            These objects help scientists understand the formation of the solar system.
        </p>

        <h3>📌 Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            The solar system is a remarkable structure that shows how diverse and complex our universe is.
            Studying planets and celestial bodies helps us understand Earth’s place in space.
